Reusable foundation for building a repository docs system that works for both humans and coding agents.

## Purpose

Use repository docs as the source of truth, with a short root entry file (`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`) as a map. This gives agents progressive disclosure: start small, then follow links into deeper docs only when needed.

This concept was adapted from this article: https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/

## Core Rules

1. Keep the root agent doc short (target: 80-140 lines).
2. Put durable, detailed knowledge in `docs/` files.
3. Split docs by intent:
- `design-docs/` for why decisions were made.
- `product-specs/` for feature behavior.
- `exec-plans/` for active/completed work and debt.
- `references/` for implementation guides and integrations.
4. Every major doc links to adjacent docs.
5. No empty files. If a section is unknown, mark it `TODO` with an owner.
6. Prefer moving existing docs with history (`git mv`) over rewriting from scratch.

## Canonical Structure

```text
AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md
ARCHITECTURE.md
docs/
  COMMANDS.md
  DESIGN.md
  FRONTEND.md
  BACKEND.md
  PRODUCT_SENSE.md
  QUALITY_SCORE.md
  RELIABILITY.md
  SECURITY.md
  design-docs/
    index.md
    core-beliefs.md
    <domain-decision>.md
  product-specs/
    index.md
    <feature>.md
  exec-plans/
    roadmap.md
    implementation.md
    tech-debt-tracker.md
    active/
    completed/
  references/
    <integration>.md
    <patterns>.md
  generated/

```

## Required Content Contract

Use this as the minimum definition of done.

### Root Agent Map (`AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`)

- Project one-liner.
- Quick start commands.
- Key directories.
- Environment constraints.
- Link table to architecture and core docs.
- Pointers to all `docs/*` domains.

### `ARCHITECTURE.md`

- System context diagram (text is fine).
- Data ownership model.
- End-to-end flow for the core action.
- Domain boundaries and directory map.
- Top architecture decisions with rationale.

### `docs/*.md` Top-Level

- `COMMANDS.md`: all build/run/test/dev/release commands.
- `DESIGN.md`: product and design principles.
- `FRONTEND.md`: UI architecture and state patterns.
- `BACKEND.md`: data model and service/backend patterns.
- `PRODUCT_SENSE.md`: users, value props, product tradeoffs.
- `QUALITY_SCORE.md`: quality rubric and current scores/gaps.
- `RELIABILITY.md`: failure modes, retries, resilience patterns.
- `SECURITY.md`: auth, authz, privacy, moderation, validation.

### `design-docs/`

- `index.md` with table: doc, status, owner, last reviewed.
- One file per important design decision.
- Each doc includes: context, options, decision, consequences.

### `product-specs/`

- `index.md` with table: feature, status, owner, linked code.
- One file per feature: user story, flows, data shape, edge cases.
- Include explicit out-of-scope list.

### `exec-plans/`

- `active/`: plans in progress with decision log.
- `completed/`: completed plans with results and follow-ups.
- `tech-debt-tracker.md`: debt item, impact, owner, priority, target date.

### `references/`

- Deep technical guides used by agents while coding.
- Prefer implementation facts over prose.
- Include commands, paths, and caveats.

## Rollout Workflow (Per Project)

1. Inventory existing docs and group by intent.
2. Create target tree and move files with `git mv`.
3. Rewrite root agent doc into a TOC-style map.
4. Create/fill missing core docs (`docs/*.md` + `ARCHITECTURE.md`).
5. Normalize cross-links and relative paths.
6. Add CI checks for structure, broken links, and stale markers.
7. Add a recurring doc-gardening task (weekly or per release).

## CI + Mechanical Enforcement

Add checks for:

1. Required file presence.
2. Broken internal links.
3. Empty files or sections.
4. Staleness policy (`Last reviewed` age threshold).
5. Plan hygiene (`active/` plan must have status + owner).
6. Ownership metadata on core docs.

## Agent Prompt Foundation (Reusable)

Use this as the seed prompt when applying the method to a new repository:

```md
Restructure this repository docs into a "system of record" model for agents and humans.

Goals:
1) Keep `AGENTS.md` (or `CLAUDE.md`) short (~100 lines) as a map only.
2) Move deep knowledge into a structured `docs/` tree.
3) Ensure progressive disclosure with strong cross-links.
4) Preserve history with `git mv` where possible.
5) Produce detailed docs (no empty files).

Target structure:
- Root: `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/`: `COMMANDS.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `FRONTEND.md`, `BACKEND.md`,
  `PRODUCT_SENSE.md`, `QUALITY_SCORE.md`, `RELIABILITY.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- `docs/design-docs/`, `docs/product-specs/`, `docs/exec-plans/`, `docs/references/`

Execution requirements:
- Start by inventorying current docs and proposing exact file moves.
- Then implement moves/rewrites and create missing docs.
- Add/update indexes for `design-docs` and `product-specs`.
- Update all internal links.
- End with a coverage report: what was created, moved, and still missing.
```

## Review Checklist

1. Can a new engineer find core architecture in under 2 minutes?
2. Can an agent start from root doc and navigate to any feature spec quickly?
3. Does each major feature have one canonical spec?
4. Are active plans and debt items visible and current?
5. Are quality, reliability, and security expectations explicit?
6. Do docs match real code paths and current commands?

## Governance

- Owners: assign one owner per core doc.
- Cadence: review core docs monthly; plans weekly while active.
- Rule: code changes that alter behavior must update corresponding spec/docs in same PR.
