# Testing the Agent Harness

How to verify that commands, skills, MCP servers, and the shared context files
(`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.github/copilot-instructions.md`) are actually
visible to each harness: **Claude Code**, **GitHub Copilot**, **Codex**, and
**Antigravity CLI**.

> **Note:** Antigravity CLI (`agy`) is the successor to Gemini CLI and shares
> Codex's `.agents/` layout for skills, context, and MCP. Most "Codex" steps
> below apply identically to Antigravity — call-outs are added where they
> diverge.

## 0. Prerequisite: run the sync

All generated files come from `.ai/` sources. Before testing anything, regenerate:

```sh
node .ai/scripts/sync.js
```

Then confirm the generated targets exist:

| Check | Path |
|---|---|
| Claude Code context | `CLAUDE.md` (root) |
| Codex / Antigravity / generic context | `AGENTS.md` (root) and `.agents/context/AGENTS.md` |
| Copilot context | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Claude Code skills/commands | `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Copilot skills | `.github/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` |
| Copilot prompts | `.github/prompts/<name>.prompt.md` |
| Codex / Antigravity skills + prompts | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (gitignored — exists only after sync) |
| Antigravity MCP profile | `.agents/mcp_config.json` (gitignored, generated) |

If a target is missing, the harness can't see it — fix the sync before debugging
the harness.

## 1. Testing slash commands / prompts

The repo ships a canary prompt for exactly this purpose:
[.ai/prompts/example-command.md](.ai/prompts/example-command.md) — its only job is to print
"Hello World" with emojis, so you can tell at a glance whether the command was
*actually loaded* or the model just improvised.

**Invocation syntax varies by surface:**

- CLI tools (Claude Code CLI, Codex CLI, Antigravity CLI `agy`, Copilot CLI) generally use `/name`.
- All four CLIs also support a `/skills` command (each in a slightly
  different form) that lists the skills the harness has discovered. This is
  the quickest way to confirm each CLI can see the skills synced/symlinked
  into its agent directory (`.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/`,
  `.github/skills/`) — if a skill is missing from the list, the sync or
  symlink is the problem, not the skill content.
- Codex and Antigravity additionally support `$name` to mention a skill directly in a message.
- IDE chat windows (Copilot Chat, Claude Code extension) often have weaker or
  slower skill autocomplete than the CLIs — a skill that doesn't show up in
  the `/` dropdown may still work when typed in full. Don't conclude a skill
  is broken from autocomplete alone; type the full command and check the
  output, or verify in the CLI.

### Claude Code

1. Type `/` in the chat input. `example-command` should appear in the list.
2. Run `/example-command`. Expected output: "Hello World" with emojis.
3. If it's not listed: check `.claude/skills/example-command/SKILL.md` exists and has
   valid `name` + `description` frontmatter, then restart the session
   (skills are indexed at startup).

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

1. Type `/` in Copilot Chat. `example-command` should appear (sourced from
   `.github/prompts/example-command.prompt.md`).
2. Run it and confirm the Hello World output.
3. If missing: check that prompt files are enabled
   (`chat.promptFiles` setting) and reload the window.

### Codex / Antigravity CLI

1. Type `/skills` to list, or `$example-command` to invoke directly. Both
   harnesses read the same `.agents/skills/` tree, so the same command shows
   up in both.
2. In Antigravity, you can also run `agy plugin import gemini` once to migrate
   any legacy Gemini CLI commands — they convert to skills automatically.
3. If missing: run the sync (`.agents/skills/` is gitignored and must be
   regenerated after every clone), and confirm the project is trusted.

## 2. Testing skills (implicit invocation)

Skills differ from commands: the agent decides to load them based on the
`description` frontmatter, without you typing a slash command.

1. Pick a skill, e.g. [.ai/skills/validate-harness-sync.md](.ai/skills/validate-harness-sync.md).
2. Ask the agent a question that matches the skill's description trigger words
   — but **don't name the skill** (for `validate-harness-sync`, try "is my
   agent harness set up correctly?" or "why isn't my new skill showing up?").
3. Ask the agent: "Which skills did you load for that answer?" or check the
   harness's tool-call log for a skill read.
4. Negative test: ask something clearly outside the skill's scope and confirm
   it does *not* load (over-triggering means the description is too broad).

If a skill never triggers implicitly, the fix is almost always the
`description` line: front-load the trigger conditions ("Use when…") and add
anti-triggers ("Do NOT use for…").

### Quick end-to-end canary: `validate-harness-sync`

The repo ships [.ai/skills/validate-harness-sync.md](.ai/skills/validate-harness-sync.md)
as both a real diagnostic *and* a self-test. A successful run proves the
agent discovered the skill, loaded its content, and acted on its
instructions — three separate links in the chain.

**Implicit invocation** (preferred — tests description-based discovery):

> "Is my agent harness set up correctly?"
> "Can you validate the harness sync in this repo?"
> "Why isn't my new skill showing up in <tool>?"

**Explicit invocation** (use if implicit doesn't trigger — isolates whether the
problem is the skill content vs. the description trigger):

- Claude Code: `/validate-harness-sync` (or type the name after `/`)
- Codex / Antigravity CLI: `$validate-harness-sync`
- Copilot: mention the skill name directly in your message

**A passing run** produces a PASS/FAIL table covering source files, composed
context files, synced skills/prompts, MCP config, and the sync manifest — see
the skill itself for the full schema. If you get a generic answer instead of
the table, the skill wasn't loaded (check that
`.claude/skills/validate-harness-sync/SKILL.md` /
`.agents/skills/validate-harness-sync/SKILL.md` /
`.github/skills/validate-harness-sync/SKILL.md` exist, then restart the
session).

## 3. Testing the shared context (AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md / copilot-instructions.md)

Use a **canary token** to prove the file is in the agent's context, rather than
asking "did you read CLAUDE.md?" (models will often say yes regardless).

1. Add a distinctive, un-guessable line to `.ai/AGENTS.md`, e.g.:

   ```markdown
   <!-- canary: the project mascot is a purple axolotl named Reginald -->
   ```

2. Run `node .ai/scripts/sync.js` so it propagates to all generated targets.
3. Start a **fresh session** in each harness (context files load at session start).
4. Ask: *"What is the project mascot?"* — no hints, no file references.

| Harness | Expected behavior |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | Answers from `CLAUDE.md` without reading any file |
| Copilot Chat | Answers from `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (check `github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.useInstructionFiles` is enabled) |
| Codex | Answers from root `AGENTS.md` (or `.agents/context/AGENTS.md`) |
| Antigravity CLI | Answers from root `AGENTS.md` (or `.agents/context/AGENTS.md`) |

5. Remove the canary and re-sync when done.

A correct answer proves the full chain: `.ai/AGENTS.md` → sync → generated
file → harness context. A wrong answer (or a file-read tool call before
answering) tells you which link is broken.

## 4. Testing MCP servers

MCP config source is `.ai/mcp-servers.json`, synced to `.mcp.json` (Claude
Code/Copilot), `.codex/config.toml` (Codex), and `.agents/mcp_config.json`
(Antigravity CLI). When `mcpServers` is empty the sync skips all three
destinations — see [.ai/docs/harness-support.md](.ai/docs/harness-support.md)
for config formats.

### Canary: the `everything` server

The starter ships with `@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything` pre-wired —
Anthropic's reference test server that exposes simple tools like `echo`,
`add`, and `printEnv`. Use it for a quick end-to-end MCP wiring check before
adding real servers:

1. After sync, the server appears as `everything` in every harness's MCP
   list (instructions per harness below).
2. Ask the agent: *"Use the `everything` MCP server to echo 'hello'"* — you
   should see a tool-confirmation prompt, then the echoed string back.
3. If the call succeeds, MCP wiring is good end-to-end. Remove or replace
   the `everything` entry in `.ai/mcp-servers.json` once you have your own
   servers to wire up. Re-run the sync to propagate the change.

> First invocation may take a few seconds while `npx -y` fetches the
> package. Subsequent calls are instant.

### Claude Code

1. Run `claude mcp list` in a terminal, or `/mcp` inside a session — the
   server should be listed as connected.
2. Ask the agent to use one of the server's tools and confirm a real tool
   call happens (visible in the transcript), not a hallucinated answer.
3. Project-scoped servers in `.mcp.json` require one-time approval on first
   use — watch for the prompt.

### GitHub Copilot (VS Code)

1. Open the Copilot Chat tools picker (the wrench icon) — the MCP server's
   tools should be listed.
2. Check `MCP: List Servers` in the command palette for connection status
   and logs.
3. Invoke a tool via chat and confirm the tool-call confirmation dialog
   appears.

### Codex

1. Run `codex mcp list` to confirm the server is registered.
2. Confirm `.codex/config.toml` starts with the `# ai-sync-generated` marker —
   if not, the sync script treats it as user-owned and won't update it.
3. Invoke a tool in a session and verify the call in the transcript.

### Antigravity CLI

1. Confirm `.agents/mcp_config.json` exists after sync and contains
   `"_ai_sync_generated": true` at the top level — this flag tells the sync
   it's safe to regenerate. A hand-edited file without that flag is preserved
   untouched.
2. Confirm any remote servers use the `serverUrl` key (the sync auto-renames
   legacy `url` / `httpUrl` fields during generation).
3. Inside an `agy` session, MCP tool calls show a confirmation prompt before
   invocation (standard MCP UX) — accept it and verify the call in the
   transcript.
4. Invoke a tool whose output you can independently verify and compare
   against ground truth.

### Generic MCP smoke test

For any harness, the strongest test is a **round trip**: ask the agent to call
a tool whose output you can independently verify (e.g. "list the files in X
via the MCP server") and compare against ground truth.

## 5. Troubleshooting checklist

- **Stale generated files** → re-run `node .ai/scripts/sync.js`; never edit
  generated files directly.
- **Harness caches context at session start** → always restart the
  session/window after a sync before testing.
- **Skill not triggering** → tighten the `description` frontmatter; Codex
  truncates the skills list at ~8,000 characters total.
- **Copilot ignoring instructions** → confirm
  `useInstructionFiles` is enabled and the file is at
  `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exactly.
- **Codex / Antigravity missing skills after clone** → `.agents/skills/` is gitignored;
  run the sync.
